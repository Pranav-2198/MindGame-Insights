## Research Overview: 

KEY QUESTION OF THE RESEARCH STUDY:
How do gaming habits, combined with various personal and societal factors, influence ones psychological health and employment status?

REASEARCH OBJECTIVE
“What is the relationship between anxiety levels (GAD) on various factors, including Satisfaction With Life Total (SWL_T), Social Phobia Inventory Total (SPIN_T), Narcissism, Hours of play, Reasons to Play (whyplay), Work Status(work), and Play Style(playstyle) preferences?”

TECHNICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Unraveling the complex interplay of diverse factors using predictive modeling and data analysis to better understand human behaviors.

SOCIETAL IMPACT
Inform policymakers and educators about the relationship between gaming, mental well-being, and employment and also offer insights to mental health professionals to address potential issues arising from gaming habits.

CONTRIBUTION TO DATA SCIENCE:
Enhancing the ability to predict and explain complex human behaviors using multifaceted data with a special focus on cyberpsychology

## Research Milestones:

Our Research Study is divided into the following three milestones:

Milestone 1: Basic Data Cleaning and Exploration
In Milestone 1 we conducted preliminary data analysis on a dataset related to gaming studies. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and more.

Milestone 2: Regression & Classification
Milestone 2  focuses on various regression and classification analyses on our dataset. The dataset contains several variables, but our primary focus is on the Anxiety Score (GAD_T) as the dependent variable.

Milestone 3: SVMs, Neural Networks, Clustering, Feature Selection & Comparative Analysis of the Models: 
Milestone 3  focuses on SVMs, Neural Networks, Clustering applicability, feature selection, and comparative analysis of our research and dataset. The dataset contains several variables, but our primary focus is on the Anxiety Score (GAD_T) as the dependent variable.
