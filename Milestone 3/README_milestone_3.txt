Overview: Milestone 3  focuses on SVMs, Neural Networks, Clustering applicability, feature selection, and comparative analysis of our research and dataset. The dataset contains several variables, but our primary focus is on the Anxiety Score (GAD_T) as the dependent variable.


How to Run the Python code: 

1. Download the MindGame_Insights_Milestone_3.1_Python_code.ipynb file. 
2. Install necessary libraries: I’ll list down the libraries that you’d need to run the project file below.
3. Open the MindGame_Insights_Milestone_3.1_Python_code.ipynb in Google Colab Notebook for easier access: or you can use jupyter to open the notebook.
4. How to use Google Colab:
   1. https://colab.research.google.com/ - Open Google Colab
   2. Create an account or log in.
   3. Go to upload > select browse and select MindGame_Insights_Milestone_3.1_Python_code.ipynb (The downloaded file)
5. Upload the clean_game dataset to the Files section on the left and clicking on Upload to session storage.
6. Run the cells in sequence from the top by pressing Shift + Enter.


To install all the libraries at once: Use the following command. 
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
